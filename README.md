DevOneCloud is a infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.
This includes both low-level components like compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS feat.

## Requirements

* Node JS :
If Node JS is not installed in your PC, do check out the link provided below:
(https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## TechStacks

* Next JS
* Tailwind CSS


## Features

* A Node.js development framework called Next Js is used to build this web solution. Next Js simplifies the process of server-side rendering and provides numerous other useful features, such as built-in CSS support, fast refresh, image optimization,dynamic routing, etc.
* Tailwind CSS was used for CSS styling because it enables complex responsive layouts to be built freely, has common utility patterns and creates small utilities with defined options that enable easy integration of existing classes directly into HTML code. Custom styling can be provided to the components with the help of this framework.
* The website was designed to be responsive, which automatically adjusts to different screen resolutions and viewports.
* For the purposes of tracking engagements, the website was connected to Google Analytics.
